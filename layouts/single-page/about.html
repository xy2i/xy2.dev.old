      ðŸ“Š A good visualization means a thousand words.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're looking for some data visualization for your application, website
      or research that tells a story and leaves the user with clear insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a data scientist specializing in data visualization. I create
      visualizations that are clear and allow users to make decisions or get
      clear insights. From research to data cleaning to design and
      visualization, I manage the entire data science pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mainly use d3.js, with strong experience with Javascript and across the
      MERN stack, using these technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SVG/Canvas visualisations with d3.js</li>
      <li>plot.ly, Highcharts, chart.js</li>
      <li>React & Vue, MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)</li>
      <li>Pandas, Jupyter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you <a href="/portfolio">check out my portfolio</a>, you'll find some
      examples of the work I do. <br />Interested?
